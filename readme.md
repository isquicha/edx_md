# edX Markdown

## Description
Live on [this URI][2]

Simple form to generate [edX Markdown][1] for a multiple choice problem with
a simple web based interface.

The code is ugly and half english half pt-BR.
This is only an MVP to a simple use case and shouldn't even be considered alpha.

The only file needed is [index][/index.html], so if you want to try, just
serve this file through a webserver =D
